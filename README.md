# Emergency_Room_Patient_Visit_Analysis_Dashboard
## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of Emergency Room Patient Visits using fake data from 2019 and 2020. The dataset is sourced from [Data World]( and contains columns such as patient demographics, visit patterns, satisfaction scores, wait times, and referral details. The analysis is visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard to derive actionable insights for healthcare decision-making.
## Key Features of this Dashboard
1.	Total Number of Patient Visits
- The total number of patients visiting the emergency room over the two years.
2.	Age Distribution Analysis
- A detailed breakdown of patient visits by age group, providing insights into which age demographics frequently visit the ER.
3.	Patient Wait Times
- Average wait times in the ER to identify trends and bottlenecks in patient flow.
4.	Daily Heatmap of Visits
- A heatmap visualization showcasing daily trends in ER visits, highlighting peak and off-peak times.
5.	Patient Satisfaction Scores
- Patient feedback based on satisfaction scores (0-10) to assess the quality of care and patient experience.
6.	Patient Visits by Race
- Analysis of patient demographics based on race, contributing to understanding diversity in patient visits.
7.	Department Referrals After ER Visits
- Insights into the departments, where patients were referred to after their ER visit, providing a pathway analysis for post-ER care.
